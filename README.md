### Hi/Bonjour/ä½ å¥½! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my humble abode! These are all of my various software projects from school projects, hackathons, co-ops, and just when I have some free time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m super interested in all things software whether that is front-end, back-end, machine learning, database management, etc.!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for cool projects to work on and to try new languages or frameworks!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunb26/ (I really encourage you to connect with me!)

#### Current Favorite Programming Language: Golang

#### Current Favourite Technology: LLMs
